To help the government fight financial crime, Federal regulation requires certain financial
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information about the beneficial owners of legal
entity customers. Legal entities can be abused to disguise involvement in terrorist
financing, money laundering, tax evasion, corruption, fraud, and other financial crimes.
Requiring the disclosure of key individuals who own or control a legal entity (i.e., the
beneficial owners) helps law enforcement investigate and prosecute these crimes.

developing a customer risk profile.
A customer risk profile refers to the
information gathered about a customer
at account opening used to develop a
baseline against which customer activity
is assessed for suspicious activity
reporting. This may include self-evident
information such as the type of
customer or type of account, service, or
product. The profile may, but need not,
include a system of risk ratings or
categories of customers.
In addition, customer due diligence
also includes conducting ongoing
monitoring to identify and report
suspicious transactions and, on a risk
basis, to maintain and update customer
information. For these purposes,
customer information shall include
information regarding the beneficial
owners of legal entity customers (as
defined in § 1010.230). The first clause
of paragraph (ii) sets forth the
requirement that financial institutions
conduct monitoring to identify and
report suspicious transactions.

 The
RIA uses Treasury’s estimate of $300
billion in illicit proceeds generated
annually in the United States due to
financial crimes, to determine the
minimum level of effectiveness that the
final rule would need to achieve for the
benefits to equal the costs. Based on this
analysis, using the upper bound of our
cost assessment, FinCEN has concluded
that the final rule would only have to
reduce illicit activity by 0.6 percent to
yield a positive net benefit. The
Treasury Department believes that the
final rule will reduce illicit activity by
a greater amount than this. 

 ‘‘Bank
Secrecy Act’’ (BSA).6 The BSA
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury
(Secretary) to require financial
institutions to keep records and file
reports that ‘‘have a high degree of
usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory
investigations or proceedings, or in the
conduct of intelligence or
counterintelligence activities, including
analysis, to protect against international
terrorism.’’ 7

company, as defined in section 10(n)
of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (12
U.S.C. 1467a(n))—§ 1010.230(e)(2)(x)
At the suggestion of several
commenters, bank holding companies,
which include financial holding
companies, have been excluded from
the beneficial ownership requirement in
the final rule because the Federal
Reserve Board maintains beneficial
ownership information on all of these
companies. Savings and loan holding
companies are excluded for the same
reason. 

Private Label Retail Credit Accounts
Established at the Point-of-Sale
One commenter requested that
FinCEN exempt point-of-sale retail
credit accounts provided to small to
mid-size business customers, including
commercial private label and cobranded credit cards and installment
loans, from the scope of coverage of the
beneficial ownership requirement. This
commenter noted that such accounts
presented a lower risk of money
laundering due in large part to
limitations on the use of those cards
inherent in these customer
relationships. For example, because
private label credit cards can be used
only to purchase goods or services at the
specified retailer at which they are
issued, they would not be an attractive
vehicle to launder illicit proceeds. That
these accounts can only be used for
domestic transactions, and generally
have lower credit limits, are additional
factors that mitigate the risk of these
accounts. FinCEN has learned that legal
entities without an established and
verifiable credit history that seek such
accounts are generally required to
provide a personal guarantee by a
natural person whose identity and
credit history are verified. We agree that
these characteristics and limitations
associated with private label credit card
accounts that are used exclusively
within issuing retailers’ networks,
significantly decrease these accounts’
susceptibility to abuse by money
launderers and terrorist financers. Thus,
covered financial institutions are
exempt from the beneficial ownership
requirement with respect to private
label credit card accounts to the limited
extent that they are established at the
point-of-sale to obtain credit products,
including commercial private label
credit cards, solely for the purchase of
retail goods and/or services at the
issuing retailer and have a credit limit
of no more than $50,000.

but rather purchase such systems from third parties

We estimate that first-year costs
would range from roughly $370 million
to $520 million; training costs would be
lower in subsequent years. Furthermore,
we estimate that the 10-year costs range
from roughly $1.15 billion to $2.15
billion in present value and that
annualized costs would range from
approximately $150 million to $290
million. 

Table 2 summarizes the estimated
costs. Estimated first year training costs
range from roughly $210 million to $260
million depending on the share of
employees trained and the duration of
the training sessions. First-year costs are
so much greater than the costs in
subsequent years for two reasons: All
employees who receive training are
given the longer initial training in the
first year, but take shorter refresher
training in the following years, and
compliance staff must design the
training in the first year.121

4 We use an estimate of 8
million new accounts per year, which
takes into account all financial accounts
that will be excluded or exempted from
the rule. We consider a range of 20 to
40 minutes of additional time on
average to open an account under the
CDD rule, based on a series of telephone
calls with covered institutions, and on
public comments received in response
to both the NPRM and the preliminary
version of the RIA published in
December 2015.125

We base a financial
institution’s cost of the additional time
spent onboarding a single account on
$16.77, the average wage for ‘‘new
account clerks’’ in the financial industry
according to data furnished by the BLS.
For a seven-percent discount rate, the
present value of onboarding costs has an
approximate range of $350 million to
$705 million; for a three-percent
discount rate, the present value of
onboarding costs is roughly $410
million to $825 million. 

121Using information provided in a comment by
a major trade association, we adopted 200 hours as
the necessary amount of time to design training per
financial institution.

 Furthermore, we use wage
data from the May 2014 BLS Occupational
Employment Statistics for ‘‘compliance officers’’
working in business establishments in sectors
having one of the four-digit North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes
mentioned in footnote 116; the average hourly wage
for these compliance officers is $34.03. The total
cost of designing trainings is the product of this
wage, 200 (hours), and the number of financial
institutions

123One of the financial institutions we
interviewed was a large bank whose representatives
stated that all of its employees would require
training for one-half hour. In the above analysis, if
all employees at all covered institutions required
one hour of initial training and subsequent annual
refresher training of 15 minutes, then the present
value of 10-year training costs would be $561
million. Although we think it is unlikely that labor
force training would need to be this widespread,
this estimate provides an upper bound for total
training costs. 

In the preliminary RIA, we used 15 and 30
minutes for the low and high scenario average
increases, respectively, in onboarding time per
account, but some commenters objected to these
values as being too low

Also, for the sake of consistency
with the computations for additional
onboarding costs for financial
institutions, we necessarily assume that
8 million new legal entity accounts are
opened each year in calculating client
costs. We use $22.71 per hour, the
weighted average hourly wage for all
employees from the May 2014 National
Occupational Employment and Wage
Estimates report. Using a seven-percent
discount rate, the present value of the
total additional cost to covered
institution clients opening a new
account range from $475 million to $955
million; the analogous figures for a
three-percent discount rate are $560
million and $1.2 billion. 

We expect that with adoption of the
final rule, SARs filed by covered
financial institutions will be
increasingly likely to include beneficial
ownership information for legal entity
accounts as, over time, the share of
accounts on which beneficial ownership
information would be gathered at
opening rises. This information would
speed the identification of complicit
individuals by law enforcement
agencies. 

The National Money Laundering Risk
Assessment 2015 estimated the annual
volume of money laundering in the
United States at $300 billion. The same
source notes that one of the key
vulnerabilities exploited by moneylaunderers is ‘‘creating legal entities
without accurate information about the
identity of the beneficial owner.’’ 1

9One small bank we surveyed reported that it
opened 471 accounts for organizations in 2014. This
number includes an unknown number of sole
proprietorships that would not be subject to the
rule, as well as 179 accounts for loan customers, for
which the bank would typically identify the
beneficial owner(s) in order to obtain personal
guarantees. A second small bank we surveyed
reported that it opened 333 accounts in 2014 for
legal entities, which includes an unknown number
of sole proprietorships, as well as 106 loan
customers. A small credit union we surveyed opens
24 to 36 accounts for businesses per year, which
includes an unknown number of sole
proprietorships. FinCEN believes its estimated
range of costs may be high because the calculation
is based on the small bank that opened the greater
number of legal entity accounts, assumes that none
of the accounts reported were opened for sole
proprietorships, and includes loan customers, for
which the bank would generally already identify
beneficial owners. The estimated cost is based on
the bank-reported 471 new accounts per year,
additional time at account opening of 15 to 30
minutes, and the average wage of $16.77 for the
financial industry ‘‘new account clerks’’ reported by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. FinCEN believes that
utilizing this number of new accounts is more
appropriate than the 1.5 new accounts per day
stated in the NPRM, since it is based on actual data
from a small bank. 

FinCEN also notes that the estimate is
almost certainly much greater than
would be the actual case for most small
credit unions. This is because FinCEN
understands that approximately 3,000
small credit unions have five or fewer
employees.181 Training for an
institution with five employees, based
on the assumptions above, would cost
much less than the $1,250 lower
estimate above. 

Although no small entities estimated the
cost for this, an industry trade
association stated that small banks
would incur expenses of nearly $13,000
to develop and administer the training. 

FinCEN notes that one credit union with
assets of $2.3 billion estimated the cost
of IT enhancements to be $23,270, and
another with assets of $2.8 billion
estimated such costs at $11,500. Given
that these institutions are several times
larger than the largest small credit
unions, it would seem that the IT
upgrade costs for small entities could be
expected to generally be less than
$10,000.182

Specifically, FinCEN increased its
estimate of the time to develop and
maintain beneficial ownership
identification procedures, from one
hour to 56 hours (40 for small entities),
and its estimate of the time for
identification, verification, and review
and recordkeeping of the beneficial
owners of legal entity customers, from
20 minutes per customer to a range of
20–40 minutes per customer. 

Estimated Recordkeeping Burden:
